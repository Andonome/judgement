\subsection{Hey there,}

Just checking you haven't got lost\ldots

This book helps \glspl{gm} set up a game of BIND, set in \gls{fenestra}.
Well, actually it's never done that before, because I'm just writing it now.
So maybe you're the first to use it raw?

Over \autoref{civilization} and \autoref{encounters}, you will map the local regions of \glsentrytext{fenestra}.
Most chapters after that help flesh out what lies there; how encounters work, and then details on the creatures people encounter.

You'll find some references to the core rules, but you can use this book with nothing but the basic rules in an adventure module, if you prefer.

\iftoggle{stories}%
  {If your players are using the \textit{Book of Stories}, you should probably have a quick read-through of the \glspl{storypoint} system (\autopageref{stories} of that book), just so you know what kind of random allies they might bring into play.}%

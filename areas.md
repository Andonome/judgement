## Area

Welcome to Fenestra.
Let's look around.

It should only take an hour...

## The Page

Take a pencil, and a blank sheet of paper.

Draw a line across the page to make a square for your map.
The rest of the page is for notes about areas on the map.
Leave room for 8 to 10 keys for the areas.

### Features of the Land

- Imagine a circle spanning your page
- Draw 6 points along the circle, evenly spaced.
- Label them 1-6.
- Roll 1D6 and draw mountains around point *N*.
- Draw hills outside of the mountains, until you reach the nearest two points.
- Take the opposite point - this is the water.
- Roll 1D6 to find out what type of watery area this is:
    1. Swamp.
    1. Lake.
    1. Large lake, which also covers the centre of the map.
        - Add 1D3 islands.
    1. Sea, extending to the edge of the map.
        - Add 1D6-1 islands, then give half a walled village.
    1. Sea, which extends to the centre of the map, then out to the edge.
        - Add 1D6 islands, each with a walled village.
    1. Vast sea. It stretches from this point, to the next numbered-point,\footnote{All points go in a circular order, so after 6 comes 1.} and then out to the edge of the map.
        - Add 1D6+1 islands to your water, and give each a walled village.
- Draw a dotted line between all islands and nearby towns, indicating sea-routes.
- Draw contour-lines around any lakes or sea.

All the land beyond your mountains is covered in forest, but do not draw it.

## Towns and Rivers

### Adding Towns

- Roll 4D6 and add one town to every point which comes up on the dice. Ignore repeats.
    - Draw a small circle to indicate the town.
    - Towns on mountains indicate dwarves.
- Draw a river from the mountains to each town.
    - Each river starts from a separate point in the mountains.
    - Rivers join after leaving a town, but never split.
    - When towns sit behind a lake, the river meets the lake instead.
- Extend each river from a town to the water, weaving through every numbered point along the way.
- For each town, add 1D6 x 2 walled villages around it.
    - Most walled villages sit next to water or rivers.
    - All walled villages have a road to their town.
    - Nearby walled villages have roads leading to each other.
- Draw a dotted line between each town, indicating a road.
- Roll 1D6 - this point has a route leading off the map, to lands uncharted. Draw the route with a dotted line.

### Famous for...

For each town, roll 1D6, and add the number of walled villages around it.

3. Cartographers
4. Deadly and magical plants
5. Bath houses
6. Trackers
7. White rock
8. Craftsmen
9. Bards
10. Madness
11. Witchcraft
12. Beast Arenas
    - Each one has 1D3 military outposts guarding against the other.
13. Friendly with the next town - the locals go back and forth all the time.
14. Statues of heroes litter the roads around.
15. Pious monks pray on every corner.
16. War is brewing with whoever lives on the next point on the map. Once the arrow supplies arrive, soldiers will march.
17. Demi-human suburbs, where all manner of other races live.
18. The grandest library in the area.

### They call it...

Select a name by combining what everyone knows it for, with the type of land.

- A town in the hills is famous for its library. That's why they call it 'Page Valley'.
- A swamp-edge town, famous for its bards, known as 'Songmarsh'.
- A town by the sea, famed for Witchery. They call it 'Hexwave'.

Write the town's name on the line next to its number.

### It is Ruled by...

For each town, roll 1D6 to determine its ruler.

1. Multiple warring factions - roll twice more, with +1 to the first roll.
2. Warlord, amassing an army to expand their power.
    - Shipments of weapons come from the road to other lands.
3. Opulent noble, who demands 20% tithes from all who enter.
    - The local hidden Oddities annoy and fascinate them equally.
4. Sorcerer king with no experience or business ruling.
    - He once killed a fiend (roll 1D6 below to find which type), how hard could balls and arranged marriages be?
5. A servant of the next fiend. All who oppose them die on the road (see below).
6. Spoilt noble who has never seen a peasant.
7. A crime-lord, with a history of theft, now risen to fortune...but not nobility.

Note the town's ruler under its name.

## Roads

- At each town, draw a road to the next town.
- If you have more than 3 towns, go half-way along each road, and connect to half-way along the opposite road (2 towns along).
- If you have a crossroads, place a Lonely Tavern.

### Lonely Taverns

These taverns exist on long stretches of road, far from any town, and charge high prices for a drink.
They must live off traders passing through, and survive whatever the forest brings out.
Normal people don't stay for long.
Those who stay a while often have problems with the local law, as these places often make their own laws.
Barkeeps punish any robbery close to the tavern harshly, but don't often care about what people do around the towns.

Roll 1D6 to find the barkeep:

1. A veteran of the Night Guard, with a hundred war-stories. Of course when he tells them, nobody can get a drink, so don't ask!
1. Someone from one of the hidden oddities - perhaps a gnome, or someone descended from a nearby lost city.
1. An outlander from so far away, nobody has ever heard of it. Every story he tells sounds made-up, but the strange accent shows he really does come from outside.
1. A powerful mage who swore an oath never to use magic again. He won't say why.
1. A collective - you stay as long as you like, earn your keep, then go when you please. Sometimes in the colder Seasons, the place just lies barren.
1. A dwarf who records all he can. The patrons say he works as a spy for someone, but they disagree about whom.

## Hidden Oddities

Every unoccupied point, plus the map's centre, receives a hidden element:

1. Goblin warren
1. Gnolls
1. Lost city
1. Witch commune
1. Elves
1. Gnomes

## Fiends

- Roll 3D6: each point which comes up has one fiend between it and the next point.
- Place the fiend on your map with the next number available, starting with '7'.
- For each fiend, roll three dice, to determine its type, wishes, and ability.

### The legendary...

1. Bandit troupe
1. Ogre king
1. Dragon
1. Dryad
1. Lich
1. Hag

Roll 1D6 twice, and add the fiend's number to each roll, to find out its desires and abilities.

*You roll a '3', indicating a dragon. You roll '2, 6'.
3+2 = 5, so this dragon needs standard medical supplies. Perhaps it has a tooth-ache.
3+3 = 6, so this dragon wears full plat armour*

### Who Wishes...

2. to return to society, without giving up their gold.
3. to cement an alliance with the next fiend.
4. something beautiful to look at.
5. standard medical equipment.
6. standard supplies from villages. It's so hard to find someone who delivers!
7. a massive pot, three bags of thyme, a gnomish cook, and four fresh men.
8. to acquire magical ingredients.
9. to find out where those nearby hidden oddities live...
10. to kill the next fiend, and take all they have.
11. to watch birds in peace (do not make noise on the road).
12. a child to raise as her own.

### Watch out, because they have...

2. gained the sympathies of some local villagers, who will help them.
3. great many soldiers - 1D3 x 30 of them exist, with around 15 in each camp.
4. made a temporary alliance with the last fiend on the list.
5. imprisoned a gnomish alchemist, and can force him to cast spells.
6. complete plate armour!
7. a powerful magical item.
8. myriad tunnels underground: currently empty, mostly. But nobody knows the full extent of them, only that myriad openings exist, most of which have been covered by a shallow layer of topsoil.
9. a small fortress on an island. No one can approach safely, or without being noticed.
10. a powerful magical item.
11. cast a spell which forces those who venture close to forget what they came for.
12. a garden which grows all manner of magical and deadly plants.

## Finishing Touches

### Name the Area

Combine the fiend with the highest number, with the local water-type.
For example:

- 'Hag' + 'lake' = 'Haglake'
- 'Dryad' + 'islands' = 'Drylands'
- 'Lich' + 'sea' = 'Portlich' (stress on the first syllable!)

### Inking

Pull out a pen and emphasise what you can.

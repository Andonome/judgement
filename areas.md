## Area

Welcome to Fenestra.
Let's look around.

### Features of the Land

- Imagine a circle spanning your page
- Draw 6 points along the circle, evenly spaced.
- Label them 1-6.
- Roll 1D6 and draw mountains around point *N*.
- Draw hills outside of the mountains, towards the two nearby points.
- Take the opposite point - this is the water. Roll 1D6 to find out what type of watery area this is:
- Roll 1D6 to find out the type of water:
    1. Swamp.
    1. Lake.
    1. Large lake, which also covers the centre of the map.
    1. Sea, extending to the edge of the map.
    1. Sea, which extends to the centre of the map, then the edge.
    1. Vast sea. It borders the next numbered point, and covers everything until the edge of the map.
- Add 2D6-4 islands to your water. Draw each one smaller than the last.
- Roll 1D6 - this point has a road leading out to other lands. Draw it with a dotted line.

All the land is covered in trees, but do not draw them.

## Towns and Rivers

### Adding Towns

- Roll 4D6 and add a town to every point which comes up on the dice. Ignore repeats.
    - Draw a small circle to indicate the town.
    - Towns on mountains indicate dwarves.
- Draw a river from the mountains to each town.
- Extend the rivers from the town to the water, touching every numbered point on the way.
- For each town, roll 1D6 and add that many walled villages around it.
    - Roll 1D6 for each walled village. It sits 1D6 miles from its town. Draw a dotted line to indicate the road.
    - Each walled town sits next to water or rivers, as evenly spaced from each other as possible.
    - If you roll an even number, the settlement has a road to the next (after the last number, comes the first).
- Take each island-covered area, and add up to 1D6 settlements.
    - If the islands lie by a point with a town, connect them.

### It is Ruled by...

1. Multiple warring factions - roll twice more, with +1 to the first roll.

4. a sorcerer king with no experience or business ruling
5. a lich who demands all the dead in the area
6. a spoilt noble who has never seen a peasant
7. A deceptive thieves' guild, with fingers in every pie

### Relations

1. War - Armies will clash soon. Draw 1D3 military outposts around each one.
1. Bitter - they do not trade or speak.
1. Neutral - draw a road connecting them, if none exists.
1. Trading - draw a road between them, going through any walled towns.
1. Allies - draw a road between them and place a Lonely Tavern upon it.

## They call it...

Select a name by combining what everyone knows it for, with the type of land.

'Rolling hills' ruled by somewhere famous for its library, might be called 'Bookhills', while a swamp, famous for its bards, might be called 'Songmarsh'.

Write its name above.

## It leads to...

Every area exists as an isolated little island, surviving alone in a sea of monstrous wilderness.
But what about the road out of the area, which travel to new cities?

Roll 1D6 to determine the number of roads out of the settlement.

1. A single road leads away from this area. If you have more than one settlement, this road leads back to last settlement.
2. Two roads out: one road back, and a new road onwards.
3. Two roads lead out, the second splits in two. There is nothing at the crossroads.
4. Three roads lead out, draw two new roads out.
5. Four main roads lead away from the area, making this a proper town. Draw three more roads away.
    * Draw two circles around it to show its importance.
6. Four roads out of this massive city.
    * Every village within 20 miles becomes a town.
    * Villages without walls surround it, protected by its infantry, and by the nearby towns.

### Cities

Cities are surrounded by little villages with no walls, and around them, more towns.
They create safety for all around them, with constant influx of guards, and the town around form a mild barrier.

### The Road Between

For each connecting settlement, draw a road.
Roll to check its length.

1. 4 miles long.
1. 8 miles long.
1. 12 miles long.
1. 16 miles long, 
1. 20 miles long.
1. Special (1D3):
    1. Draw a road to any previous settlement.
    1. A lonely tavern sits along this 24 mile road, with its own walls and supplies.
    1. This 24 mile road splits in two half way along.

Draw the road at a scale of 1 mile = 0.5 cm.

### Relationship

Each new settlement has a relationship to its neighbour.

1. Hatred: war brews between the two nobles.  Neither trusts sentries of the other.
2. Irritation: the two sides have had little skirmishes, and plenty of disagreements about which villages belong to whom.
3. Neutral parties - neither speaks much with the other, but as long as trade seems mutually profitable, no problem.
4. Allies in trade - their people depend upon each other for their primary goods.
5. Alliances have been sworn, and they have embarked upon a shared venture.
6. Fierce allies - neither will break their word when given to the other, and they seek to make as many more connections together as they can.

Draw its relationship along the road.

# Local Fiends

Horrifying creatures and groups hold large territories, and humans generally live, and forge roads, along the borders.
If neither feind wishes to approach the other, then the border between the groups becomes a little safer.

Take a cell which exists between your civilizations, created by the roads, and roll to find what kind of fiend lives there.

## The legendary...

1. Troupe of outlaws
1. Ogre king
1. Necromancer
1. Dragon
1. Dryad

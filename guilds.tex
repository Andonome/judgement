\chapter{Guilded Temples}

Nothing in \gls{fenestra} exists to serve.
As any idiot can plainly see, everything in the world wants to strangle civilization, and kill everything which walks on the surface.
So when people look to the divine, they do not look for salvation, but for danger.

Each of the gods in \gls{fenestra} takes the souls of those who die in their domain back to their own realm.
The god of the cold takes those who freeze to death, and the god of the forests takes the souls of those eaten by the forest's creatures.

Temples exists to protect civilization from the wrath of their god.
Each one also has a divine monopoly within their domain, which includes anything that could plausibly defend against the god.

The temples are guilds, and each guild hall also serves as a temple.
Citizens of \gls{fenestra} make no distinction between asking for salvation from violence and purchasing armour.
The captains of the \gls{guard} may as well be bishops, and priests of the Temple of Poison shepherd the civilized world with preservatives.

  {The most terrifying of the gods has an empty realm.
  Not a single soul resides in her realm, as she kills so thoroughly that her victims never were.

  Speaking her name attracts her attention, so it soon became a curse, then a rarity, and eventually became forgotten.
  The doula claim pass her name from one to another, by entering each others' dreams, then writing the name on sand, one glyph at a time.
  }% God
  {Failure to thrive, regret, the road untaken}% Domain
  {Hope}% Defence
  {Doula}% Watchers
  {Everyone who wants to start something new goes to the doula -- whether starting a business venture, asking someone to marry them, or just travelling between towns, people request the doula's blessings.
  }% Guild activities

  Almost every village has one, and few have more (except when they take on an apprentice.
  They frequent towns less often, as the demand on their attention rises rapidly once people know a doula is available.
  Despite the high demand for their attention, they never charge much -- everyone knows they should, by rights, given their blessings in return for a scarf, or a little meat.
  If people see them charging much more, they generally accuse the doula in question of going sour, and begin to refer to her as a `witch'.

  \paragraph{Rank \& Structure}
  stay carefully hidden from public view.
  A few doula know real witchcraft, but those who do won't display it, so those who don't can hint that they have it.
  When one casts a soothsaying spell, she tells others.
  And almost nobody can really track how effective a blessing has been.

  \begin{description}
    \item[Apprentices]
    serve for as long as it takes to pick up the basics -- often until their teacher has died (which means they get to keep the house).
    \item[Doula]
    care for the young, assist with births, and wish people well on new ventures; and whether or not their blessings truly change people's fate; or their predictions really see the future, nobody can tell.
    \item[Wayfinders]
    have sufficient magical abilities that they walk fearlessly through even the deepest parts of the forest.
    Wardens pay them handsomely (but rarely in direct coinage) to seek out areas in the forest fit to built a walled village.

    While the doula never like to reveal their rank, seeing an old woman walk out of the green darkness, where even the \glspl{guard} fear to enter, with twigs clogging up her hair, quickly gives the game away.

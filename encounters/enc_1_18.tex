An auroch herd wanders a mile away, and can be tracked more easily than the road (which they have mostly destroyed), though getting back won't be easy.

\begin{boxtext}
  Mist on snow makes a bland morning.
  The world turns into nothing but a series of brown tree-trunk lines which let you know you've walked too far from the road.
  And when hoof-prints start appearing in the ground, this lets you know that you've entered a path laid by aurochs.

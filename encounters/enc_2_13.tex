  Rain turns the ground to mince.
  Walking requires focus.
  But the wagons roll on, and the beasts seem undisturbed by the rain, but keep looking to their right.

A herd of auroch are coming.
They pass quietly, surrounding the caravan.
But if disturbed, they may stampede, destroying carts and injuring people.

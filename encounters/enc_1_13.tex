A lightning storm rages throughout the night (\glspl{pc} receive 4~\glspl{mp}).
A few fires start nearby, all across the forest (and perhaps in \pgls{village} if the \glspl{pc} are present).
\ifglsused{snow}{}{%
  By morning, \gls{snow} falls.
  It \glsentrydesc{snow}.
}

\begin{boxtext}
  The white forest smells of charcoal, and old eggs.
\end{boxtext}

What the \glspl{pc} may not have realized, is that the lightning storm woke three \glspl{basilisk} from hibernation.%
\footnote{Their cavern lies nearby, full of \gls{basilisk} bones.  It leads down into the \gls{deep}.}
They are starving, and will fight to the death.

Each \gls{basilisk} heads in a different direction, but they will hear any nearby fights and come running.

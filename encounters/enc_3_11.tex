\begin{boxtext}
  An old man arrives wheezing, with sweat dripping down his moustache.

  \begin{speechtext}
    Two\ldots
    In hole\ldots
    Horse\ldots

    Ate my horse and.
  \end{speechtext}
  Then the old man collapses.

\Pgls{crawler} sprang from a hole by the road and ate his horse.
Another attacked from the side, so the trader sprinted a mile on a broken ankle.

Once up, he can tell the \glspl{pc} what happened.

\begin{exampletext}
  Last week, the first \gls{crawler} entered \pgls{digger}'s hole, ate it, then scraped out some earth to widen it.
  A second \gls{crawler} arrived to mate.
\end{exampletext}

\begin{boxtext}
  A mile down the road, the wagon sits lopsided from a broken wheel, under dark clouds.
\end{boxtext}

The hole poses no danger (the pair have two horses to eat).
But if the \glspl{pc} don't pull back the wagon, expose their hole, and kill them, then others will die when in the coming days.

Six \glspl{griffin} block the road, eating a deer, as thunder roars above.
They attack anyone who interferes, but after a few hours they pick the carcass clean and leave, as the thunder dissipates, and the sky clears.

\begin{boxtext}
  Six hooded figures huddle together, then a face rears, with a beak.
  The cowl unfurls into wings.
  More heads look up.
  They eye you suspiciously, opening their leathery wings as a threat.
\end{boxtext}

Any horses with the troupe freak out.

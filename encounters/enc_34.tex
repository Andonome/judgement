\stepDay{1}
\Pgls{weapon} has become old and will break soon, if not properly cared for.
\begin{boxtext}
  Your longsword's looking rusty, and needs a new grip.
\end{boxtext}

Which \gls{pc} this affects, depends on a few factors.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Start with the \glspl{pc} with the lowest Crafts \gls{skill}.
  \item
  Out of those \glspl{pc}, select whoever has the highest Strength Bonus.
  \item
  If multiple \glspl{pc} have the same Strength Bonus, select whoever has the most \glspl{fp}.
  \item
  If the \gls{weapon} has a name, move to the next \gls{pc} (as it's clearly well tended for).
\end{enumerate}

Taking care of the \gls{weapon} requires an \roll{Intelligence}{Crafts} roll at \tn[10] (do not tell the player the \gls{tn}).
Failure indicates that it breaks the next time it's used.
A tie indicates that the \gls{pc} knows that it's about to break.

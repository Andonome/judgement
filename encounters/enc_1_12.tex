A boar snuffles around the troupe's camp in the morning.
If they're in \pgls{bothy}, they hear grunts outside.
If they're camping, they hear it pulling up the earth in search of the remains of mushrooms.
It flees the moment it sees anyone.

\Gls{snow} begins to fall soon after.
\ifglsused{snow}{}{%
  It \glsentrydesc{snow}.

  This morning brings a milky-white world.
  Taller people can see a little farther than shorter people, but nobody sees well.

\griffin

One sees well: \pgls{griffin}.
It swoops down, and picks up the  shortest member of the group.

The claws inflict standard Damage, and the attack is also a grab.

If the \gls{griffin} grabs someone and they struggle, it drops them onto a rock nearby, from a height of 4~\glspl{step}.
If they don't struggle, it takes them to a tree-top to begin feeding.

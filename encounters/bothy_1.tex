\subsubsection{\composeHumanName\ \Glsfmttext{bothy}}
hosts two \glspl{guard} deserters who beg for food from passing traders.
They've never fought \pgls{monster}, and don't fancy their chances.

Once they see the troupe arriving, they panic, then pull charred wood from the fire, and swallow it.

\begin{boxtext}
  The sound of heave-coughing echoes all around the \gls{bothy}.
  At least two people --- a man and a woman --- sound like they're dying.
\end{boxtext}

An \roll{Intelligence}{Medicine} roll at \tn[10] lets \pgls{pc} identify the `disease' (eating charred wood).

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} arrest them,}
they won't fight.
A week later, both die in the nearest \gls{court}, fighting \pgls{crawler} with a rusty spoon for the crowd's entertainment.

  \paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} let them go,}
  they join local bandits to survive.
  They learn from their time here, and leave poisoned bottles of wine in \glspl{bothy} which render people immobile.

  Thunder rumbles above.
  By evening, it starts roaring.
\end{boxtext}

The loud noises excite \glspl{crawler}.
Two stalk the forest, separately, and unaware of each other.

Rolling 12 means noticing both \glspl{crawler}.

The \glspl{crawler} both want to take nearby prey, but if they come too close, they attack each other.
One attacks the character with the highest Strength (probably a horse, if any are present) and the other attacks the character with the lowest Strength Bonus (probably a dog, if any are present).

\chitincrawler
\Pgls{crawler} watches the troupe from the shadows of the forest, just 10~\glspl{step} from them.
The \glspl{pc} may spot it with a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at
\setTN{Wits}{Stealth}
\tn.
\ifnum\value{r12}>\value{hp}
  The \gls{crawler} flees at the first sign of aggression.

  The \gls{crawler} attacks immediately.
  Each Failure Margin on the roll removes \pgls{ap}.

\woodspy

\stepDay{3}

This misty morning limits vision to 50~\glspl{step}.
Landmarks become invisible, and if the \glspl{pc} don't have a road to follow, they must wait \pgls{interval} for the mist to clear, or guess their route with a \roll{Intelligence}{Survival} roll at \tn[10].

The mist also provides perfect cover for \pgls{woodspy}.
The troupe can roll \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} against the \gls{woodspy}'s \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth} at \tn.
If they fail, it grabs the last character by the neck, squeezing the breath from them, and stopping them calling for help.

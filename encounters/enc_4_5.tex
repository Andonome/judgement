Any horses with the troop will notice the stench of the \gls{basilisk} immediately, and become jittery.
A \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} (\tn[10]) allows the troop to notice and understand the smell before the \gls{basilisk} hears them.
If they fail the roll, hiding requires a \roll{Wits}{Stealth} roll at \tn[10], with +1 to the \gls{tn} for every person in the group.

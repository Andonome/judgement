    \Glspl{griffin} love to hunt on overcast days.
    Spotting it requires a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[12], and each Failure Margin removes \pgls{ap}.

    The \gls{griffin} dives down to the smallest member of the troupe (perhaps an animal) and tries to grab them, then fly off in a single dive-bomb motion.
    If it fails, it flees.

  Fresh boar tracks lie on the road,
  People consider this good luck, as it means he lives here, so nothing has eaten him yet.
\end{boxtext}

The troupe can hunt the boar with a roll of \roll{Dexterity}{Stealth}.
On a success, they find him pulling up mushrooms in a clearing of daffodils, a mile up the road, but first ask the players what the plan is.
If they plan to use a bow from a distance, that's \tn[8] to sneak up on it, but \tn[12] to hit with an arrow.
If they want to move closer, the \gls{tn} to approach the boar increases, but the \gls{tn} to hit with an arrow decreases.

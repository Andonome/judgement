  \stepDay{1}
  Some local gnolls and humans have found a gnomish warren.
  The gnomes don't like people knowing where they live, but don't want to relocate.
  They decided to plant fake doors, creating myriad rumours about Gnomish warrens.

  \begin{boxtext}
    A ray of Sunlight illuminates a tiny door on the side of a tree, a hundred \glspl{step} through the forest's
    \ifnum\value{temperature}>0%
      thick shadows.
    \else
      snowy darkness.
    \fi
  \end{boxtext}

  If the \glspl{pc} investigate, they find the door `stuck'.
  If they yank hard enough, it breaks, revealing nothing behind it except a tree.

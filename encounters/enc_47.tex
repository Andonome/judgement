  A nearby bear has not prepared, and approaches them when the \gls{hurricane} hits.
  If the troupe have found \pgls{bothy}, it wants inside as well.
  If they run to \pgls{village}, it climbs the walls.

  If they let it in, the bear sits quietly, as long as nobody touches it, then leaves once the wind dies down, after twenty minutes.

  At the \gls{interval}'s end, the troupe regain 4~\glspl{mp}.

Distressed yelping echoes from the forest.
The \glspl{pc} can try an \roll{Intelligence}{Survival} roll at \tn[10] to understand this sound comes from a wolf.
If they beat \tn[12], they figure out that wolves usually make this sound when \pgls{digger} catches them.
\Glspl{digger} have no voice, so their `mating call' consists of catching an animal, pulling it half-way into their warren, and letting it scream until it dies.

\begin{boxtext}
  The wind howls.
  Something else howls too, but it's hard to hear over the wind.
  Both sound like they're in pain.
\end{boxtext}

If the troupe investigate, they find the wolf stuck half-way down \pgls{digger} tunnel.
Within \pgls{interval}, a female \gls{digger} arrives, but runs away if it spots the \glspl{pc}.

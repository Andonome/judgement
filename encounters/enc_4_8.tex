  Trees in the distance bend outward.
  Green legs slink up further, with a tail wrapped below for balance.
  And as the monster watches you, branches the size of tent-poles begin to break under its weight.
  It drops below the canopy, out of sight.

  The \gls{basilisk} attacks the \gls{pc} with the loudest player.

    Three puddles lie connected.
    They form the splayed toes of a bird, or would if birds had feet larger than your head.

  \Pgls{basilisk} left the footprint-puddle yesterday.

  \paragraph{If the troupe visit any local \glspl{village},}
  they find people have become paranoid, as they suffer from Mindflash Syndrome.%

  Something upriver is making them sick, though the farmers argue about the cause.

  \paragraph{If the troupe track the \gls{basilisk},}
  they find it five miles upriver, inside the river, where nothing can smell it.
  The \gls{basilisk} raises its nostrils above the surface every few minutes.
  The troupe can try a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[10] to spot the beast, or it launches a sneak attack.%

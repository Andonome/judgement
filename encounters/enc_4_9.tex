  A massive web lies across the road ahead.
  The trees to the left look rancid with old and new webs.
  Forty \glspl{step} behind, a brown thorax pokes out of the forest and begins making a squelching sound as webbing shoots out and sticks to the trees.
  The hairy thorax wipes the webbing onto a tree-trunk, completing the web across the road, then walks into the forest.

Two \glspl{crawler} made this mass of webbing.
One has left to hunt, and returns soon; the other has sealed the exit-road, and will attack from the troupe's right.

This windless \gls{interval} brings only 2~\glspl{mp}.

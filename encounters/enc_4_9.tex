  A massive web lies across the road ahead.
  The trees to the left look rancid with old and new webs.
  Forty \glspl{step} behind, a brown thorax pokes out of the forest and begins making a squelching sound as webbing shoots out and sticks to the trees.
  The hairy thorax wipes the webbing onto a tree-trunk, completing the web across the road, then walks into the forest.

The male grabs as many as it can, while the female only grabs one, and waits for $1D6$ days to give birth, and feed the character to her young.

This windless \gls{interval} brings only 2~\glspl{mp}.

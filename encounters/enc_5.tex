\begin{exampletext}
  \composeHumanName, \pgls{tender} from the \gls{wheatGuild}, had to abandon her grain and grape goods once she noticed that one of her horses had a stirge-infection, with a full hive steadily growing inside it.
  She took the other horse, and fled to the nearest town.
\end{exampletext}

Soon, \glspl{server} from the \gls{templeOfPoison} will return for the goods.
Meanwhile, the horse remains mad with pain and nearly dead, as it carries a complete stirge hive, hanging off its abdomen like a head-sized tumour.

\stirgeSwarm

The horse will approach the \glspl{pc} once they approach the lifeless wagon.

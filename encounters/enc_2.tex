\griffin[\npc{\T[6]\A}{\arabic{noAppearing} \Glsfmtplural{griffin}}]

\begin{boxtext}
  Six \glspl{griffin} block the road, eating a deer, as thunder roars above.
  They eye you suspiciously, opening their leathery wings as a threat.
\end{boxtext}

They attack anyone who interferes, but after a few hours they pick the carcass clean and leave, as the thunder dissipates, and the sky clears.

Any horses with the troupe freak out.

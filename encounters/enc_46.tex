  \stepDay{3}
  A lightning storm rages throughout the night (\glspl{pc} receive 4~\glspl{mp}).
  A few fires start nearby, all across the forest (and perhaps in \pgls{village} if the \glspl{pc} are present).
  \ifglsused{snow}{}{%
    By morning, \gls{snow} falls.
    It \glsentrydesc{snow}.
  }

  \begin{boxtext}
    The white forest smells of charcoal, and old eggs.
  \end{boxtext}

  What the \glspl{pc} may not have realized, is that the lightning storm woke three \glspl{basilisk} from hibernation.
  They are starving, and will fight to the death.

  Each \gls{basilisk} heads in a different direction, but they will hear any nearby fights and come running.

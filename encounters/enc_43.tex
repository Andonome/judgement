  \begin{boxtext}
    Thunder roars above, and a boar stands on the road, staring vindictively with bright-red eyes.
  \end{boxtext}

  This boar won't fight, it's too ill (players can notice with a \roll{Wits}{Survival} roll at \tn[10]).
  Anyone handling the corpse contracts \nameref{Guardbane}.%
  \exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{Guardbane}
  The cook should roll \roll{Intelligence}{Cultivation} at \tn[10]; failure indicates everyone eating the meal has contracted the disease too.

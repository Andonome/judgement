If the troupe search around, they may find \arabic{r2t4} hibernating \glspl{crawler} under a pile of snow (\roll{Intelligence}{Survival}, \tn[10]).
Any harsh movements (stamping on the ground, or hitting them) awakens them.
They wake with a -8~Penalty, which decreases by 1 each \gls{round}.

  Snow dances down.
  The morning sparkles.
  A massive web stands frozen between two trees nearby.

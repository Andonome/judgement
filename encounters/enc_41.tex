  This morning, \glspl{griffin} watch quietly, listening to anyone who calls out to animals (traders calling to horses, \glspl{pc} calling to their dogs, et c.).
  
  \griffin[\npc{\T[4]\A}{\Glsfmtplural{griffin}}]

  The \glspl{pc} may spot them with a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll
  \setTN[3]{Dexterity}{Stealth}
  at \tn\ (they stay well back, 50~\glspl{step} into the forest).

  By evening, the \glspl{griffin} begin immitating any speech directed at animals, hoping to coax a confused dog or donkey off the path.

A pile of \glspl{crawler} lie dormant under a pile of snow (\roll{Intelligence}{Survival}, \tn[10], to suspect hibernating \glspl{crawler}).
Any harsh movements (stamping on the ground, or hitting them) awakens them (but not sound, as they are completely deaf in this state).
They wake with a -8~Penalty, which decreases by 1 each \gls{round}.

\begin{boxtext}
  Snow dances down.
  The morning sparkles.
  A massive web stands frozen between two trees nearby.
\end{boxtext}

And when they wake, every one will attack and feed, without fear of death.
And if they see nothing to hunt, they will eat each other, then half will sleep again.

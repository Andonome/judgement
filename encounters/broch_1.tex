\footnotemark[\thefootnote]
is \pgls{broch} which sits in an idyllic clearing,
\ifcase\thetemperature%
  with flat, white, snow, for a hundred steps in every direction, next to a frozen pool.

  bursting with flowers, which surround a shimmering pool.

It has all the amenities --- a nearby stream, a privy on the stairway, and twenty halberds for anyone who needs a weapon.

Unfortunately, too many locals have been taken by the forest, and they blame the \glspl{guard}, especially \Gls{jotter}~\composeHumanName, for the lack of aid.
As a result, the nearby \glspl{village} will not sell anything to \glspl{guard} who frequent Droch, so the \gls{broch} has no arrows, and has nearly run out of food.

\footnotetext{Humans believe the forest eats the best things in life, so giving something a beatiful name has become a kind of curse.}
The \gls{broch} currently hosts twelve \glspl{guard}.
Three \glspl{gDigger} stay here while they heal from their injuries,
three senior members stay because they don't like going out (\pgls{thane}, \pgls{builder}, and the \gls{jotter}), 
and six \glspl{soldier} will leave tomorrow (at which point another six will arrive).

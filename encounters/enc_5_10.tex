  Sunrise is cancelled.
  Instead, the morning slowly reveals mist as thick as clouds.

The troupe can see the first coming with a \roll{Wits}{Vigilance} roll at \tn[12].
Each Failure Margin removes \pgls{ap}, and three dive within the first \gls{round}.
They attack the tallest person first, then any horses present.

If one dies, the rest retreat and watch from the trees, occasionally mimicking anything they hear, and wait to attack again at night.

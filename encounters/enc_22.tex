\begin{boxtext}
  As the Sun sets, the sky growls, and the rain picks up.
  Once everything is soaking and dark, lightning flashes, illuminating a massive, green head in the forest, a hundred \glspl{step} away.
  Your hairs all stand up straight.

\Glspl{basilisk} don't usually hunt in the dark, but they make an exception for lightning storms as the light helps them see.
And this \gls{basilisk} has seen the troupe just as they saw it.

Everyone's hairs stand on end because static electricity has built up in the air.
At the end of the second \gls{round} of combat, lightning strikes the tallest creature in the area (probably the \gls{basilisk}), inflicting $1D6\times 3$~Damage.
Anyone striking the \gls{basilisk} at that point receives half the Damage (and the \gls{basilisk} receives the other half).

\basilisk

If the troupe kill the \gls{basilisk}, they find it covered in liskshine -- a valuable lichen which grows on \glspl{basilisk}.%
\exRef{judgement}{Judgement}{liskShine}
It serves as two Earth \glspl{ingredient}.

After the lightning storm, the \glspl{pc} regain 4~\glspl{mp}.

  Ahead, an old, bronze, statue to \gls{thane}~Thornfletch, who killed 100 \glspl{crawler}, stands quietly in the rain.
  He's depicted with his great axe, and a tumour around his bear chest.
\end{boxtext}

The `tumour' is \pgls{woodspy} who's hiding on the statue.
It can match colour and texture, but doesn't understand that the statue should represent a man, so it cannot camouflage properly.

If the troupe approaches,
the \gls{woodspy} flees%
\ifnum\value{r12}<\value{hp}%
  , but keeps close by, stalking the \glspl{pc} from afar%

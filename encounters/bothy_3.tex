\subsubsection{\composeHumanName\ \Glsfmttext{bothy}}

\Gls{ranger} \composeHumanName\ was been stung by a swarm of stirges, and they have grown their nest in his chest (as stirges often do).
He crawled into this \gls{bothy} and died last night.

\begin{boxtext}
  Before opening the quiet door, the stench of rot wafts out.
\end{boxtext}

Anyone with the Medicine \gls{skill} will know this person is dead from the smell alone.

\begin{boxtext}
  A man in black leather armour lies next to the cold fireplace, groaning, or maybe humming.
\end{boxtext}

Once someone approaches the corpse, the stirges become angry, and buzz loud, then attack.

\currentName's shortsword, rotten \rations, purse (with \lootMedium) lies at their side.

\stirgeSwarm

The stirges will die within a week, because their nest lies in the dark, which makes them sleepy.

\paragraph{If the \glspl{pc} smoke them out,}
the stirges leave through the chimney.
But if the chimney's blocked, they become docile and incapacitated within half an hour.

\stepDay{4}
The troupe find a nice clearing in a forest, and it's the perfect spot to camp.
It's also full of soft earth, which is why \pgls{digger} waits for them lay down.

The players can roll \roll{Wits}{Survival} (\tn[10]) to notice the disturbed earth.
Failure means the \gls{digger} attacks the party member with the most \glspl{fp} during the night.

\set{tn}{Dexterity}
\addtocounter{tn}{\value{Brawl}}
\addtocounter{tn}{2}

A successful attack lets the \gls{digger} pull the \gls{pc} back down into its hole, at least a little.
The surprise attack means the player can only roll $2D6$ to resist, without Bonuses, at \tn.
\addtocounter{tn}{-5}
Each Failure Margin covers 1~\gls{hp} of height; so rolling \arabic{tn} means characters with 8~\glspl{hp} would be pulled into the hole up to their chest, while characters with 5 or fewer \glspl{hp} would be pulled underground entirely.

    1. A tiny archipelago, far away.

### Known by the name...

Name your new area by combining the type of land, with something everyone knows about it.
An area of rolling hills known for witches might be 'Witch Valley'.
A swamp known for its trackers might be 'Track Marsh'.

# The Neighbours

# The road out...

Every area exists as an isolated little island, surviving alone in a sea of monstrous forest.
But what about the road out of the area, which travel to new cities?

Roll 1D3 to determine the number of roads out of the settlement.

1. A single road leads away from this area. If you have more than one settlement, this road leads back to last settlement.
2. Two roads lead out.
3. Three roads lead out, making the area an active location for trading.
4. Four main roads lead away from the area.
    * It contains a massive city, not simply a town at the centre.
    * It contains 1D3 other walled towns inside its borders.
    * One road must go to the settlement before the last (if it exists).

### The Road Between

1. 1 days' travel, leading through a village in no-man's land.
2. A lonely road, often populated by bandits, 1D4 days' travel away.
3. 1D2 days' travel, but often beset by chitincrawlers.
4. 1D4 days' travel, with a fortified tavern half way through.
5. A long road, 1D4+4 days' travel away.
6. A road cursed by a druid, who keeps making the trees cross the road. It's safe enough if you can avoid getting lost.

### Relationship

Each new settlement has a relationship to its neighbour.

1. Hatred: war brews between the two nobles.  Neither trusts sentries of the other.
2. Irritation: the two sides have had little skirmishes, and plenty of disagreements about which villages belong to whom.
3. Neutral parties - neither speaks much with the other, but as long as trade seems mutually profitable, no problem.
4. Allies in trade - their people depend upon each other for their primary goods.
5. Alliances have been sworn, and they have embarked upon a shared venture.
6. Fierce allies - neither will break their word when given to the other, and they seek to make as many more connections together as they can.

\noindent
These are the five sentient races which change the face of Fenestra.
Only humans and gnolls can sleep above ground.

\subsection[Dwarves]{\Dw\ Dwarves}
\index{Dwarves}
\label{best_dwarves}

\begin{boxtext}

  You can't read dwarvish, but writing on cavern walls, in blood never, looks friendly.
  Nevertheless, there's no going back.

\end{boxtext}

Dwarves can make excellent underground enemies or friends depending upon the characters' missions.
Generally, if the characters are law-abiding types and have the good grace to send a letter ahead of themselves politely asking for aid, they will receive at least a Spartan welcome.
If they share any enemies with the dwarves, they can expect a hero's welcome, including free weapons, food, and the promise of ale if they return.

Dwarven traders also travel the land to sell their strong ales or purchase products otherwise unavailable.
They might even be stuck into an adventure as part of another culture as some few \glspl{village} have hosted dwarves for a decade or more as part of the cultural exchanges which dwarven matriarchs occasionally drive.

\begin{boxtext}

  Your friendliest voice bounces down the tunnel, and movement starts.
  It sounds like there could be ten of them, but it's hard to tell with all the echoing.

  Only six come out, all with grimy faces, but shining, well-polished plate armour.
  The first says ``I know this isnae your faults lads, but if yous leave, it'll be little stories going up before long''.

  ``Death before taxes!'', he shouts.

  Looking back, the runes have already cast a forcefield across the tunnel behind you, and the dwarves have raised their crossbows.

\end{boxtext}

\newBeast[\M\Dw]{Trader}% Name
  {dwarven_trader}% label
  {known for stable prices}% description


Your standard dwarvish citizen is a gruff male who works with his hands.

\dwarventrader

\newBeast[\Dw]{Soldier}% Name
  {dwarven_soldier}% label
  {short and deadly as a dagger}% description

Dwarvish soldiers sport proud suits of plate armour, making them nearly impenetrable to normal weapons.

\dwarvensoldier[\npc{\M\Dw}{Soldier}]

\paragraph{Tactics:} Dwarven  warriors typically \textit{charge} and trust to their plate armour to keep them safe in battle.%


\newBeast[\M\Dw]{Runemaster}% Name
  {dwarven_runemaster}% label
  {their spells lay the foundation of dwarvish cities and towns}% description

Every dwarven citadel hosts at least one rune master, who uses their spells to give blessings, and keep the edges of stronghold free from enemies.
The greatest of runemasters can protect entire settlements with their wide-ranging spells, and advise the matriarchs.
While most are female, some males have been taught by their mothers.
`Runemaster', is among the most prestigious roles a dwarven male might attain.

\subsection[Elves]{\El\ Elves}
\index{Elves}
\label{best_elves}

\begin{boxtext}

  Most of the elves are engaged in a communal song, but two stand at the side arguing.
  They look like children, except for the eyes which appear old and stressed.
  The leaves all around seem to sway and faintly grow in response to the song.

\end{boxtext}

Elves can forget about the outside world and forget to protect themselves quite easily, perhaps not noticing that in the last fifty years a new human settlement complete with an army has appeared, or that gnolls have invaded the area.
If characters even encounter a settlement, the elves will probably initially treat them like any other passing animal or be surprised by the idea that there are more humans about.
Travelling elves are usually less snobbish and are better at imitating human customs such as wearing clothing.
Many take to the human roads to wander the earth, trying to bring back the wisdom of gnomish warrens to their lands, and occasionally stopping in human towns and exchanging their jewellery for a bottle of wine and a meal.

\begin{boxtext}

  As soon as you speak with the arguing elves one looks aside, then points to the setting sun.
  You turn to look at it for a moment and it instantly sets, leaving the forest dark, without a hint the elves were there.

  Your guide informs you that you've been staring at the Sun vacantly since you spoke to the elf ealier.
  Just staring, and not saying anything to anyone.

\end{boxtext}


\newBeast[\El]{Wanderers}% Name
  {elf}% label
  {always running about on `quests' which never go anywhere}% description

Given their long lives, most elves do surprisingly little.
Nevertheless, after enough decades, almost all pick up a few crafts, or at least learn some social graces.
Almost all will know basic Wyldcrafting in order to survive.

\paragraph{Encounters:}
Most of the elves characters might meet will be wanderers who want to see the wider world.
Most will come across as tourists, which looks rather strange in a world with almost no tourism.
Others, with less social skills, typically come across as patrons of a zoo.

They have a reputation as being assassins, which most work hard against, although many still practice with their short, thin blades enough to keep themselves safe.

\paragraph{Tactics:} When they need to fight, elvish blades are fast.
They prefer fighting in the darkness as their heightened senses give them a distinct advantage.
While elvish blades are sharp, they do not have the strength to damage people wearing heavy armour, so most avoid any fights with those in heavy armour.

\elf[\npc{\E\El}{Wanderer}]


\newBeast[\El]{Enchanter}% Name
  {elven_enchanter}% label
  {if they see you, they own you}% description

Elven enchanters have hundreds of years to perfect not only their natural magics but also outside magic Paths -- often the Path of Song.

\index{Gnolls}
\label{best_gnolls}


\newBeast[\Nl]{Hunter}% Name
  {gnoll_hunter}% label
  {known everywhere for selling fresh meats, and giving free advice}% description

\gnollhunter[\npc{\M\E\Nl}{Gnoll Hunter}]

\pic{loh/gnoll}

\paragraph{Encounters:} Gnoll encounters have to be viewed entirely in terms of the local territories.
If the territory belongs to the gnolls, they will do as they please to the characters, but are unlikely to be preparing for a fight.
If the territory does not belong to the gnolls, they will be polite, and immediately explain their reasons for where they are, and explain they intend to leave as soon as their business is concluded.
\paragraph{Tactics:}
If the territory is disputed, the gnolls are dangerous, and eternally prepared for a dirty fight; they will strike at night, throw spears over an area, then rush to kill the largest target they can see in unison.

\begin{boxtext}

  Approaching the settlement, dozens of dogs run out barking.
  They look massive, almost large enough for a gnome to mount and ride.
  More barking from behind them turns out to be a gnoll shouting orders, and the dogs stop just shy of trying to tear you apart.
  The entire village come out of their tents, and away from their fires, and form a semi-circle in front of you; perhaps 20 in total.

\end{boxtext}

\newBeast[\Nl]{Druids \& Witches}% Name
  {gnoll_shaman}% label
  {fast casters, who use practical magic to hunt and make homes}% description

In gnoll societies, spellcasters feel less `distance' than in other societies.
Their peers expect them to hunt (even if they have odd methods), marry, and celebrate normally.
Human casters often point to this integration as the reason gnoll casters rarely achieve the same magical power that other casters do.
Gnoll casters point to this as the reason that `normal witches' are such weird people.

\gnollshaman[\npc{\E\Nl}{Shaman}]

\begin{boxtext}

  The gnolls don't respond, just stare.  
  Slowly, an old creature wanders forward, and the semi-circle part for him.
  He looks like a proper old dog, but the bones piercing his ear show him to be a priest of some kind.

  ``How may we help?'', he asks innocently, while the other gnolls wait patiently.

\end{boxtext}

\subsection[Gnomes]{\Gn\ Gnomes}
\index{Gnomes}
\label{best_gnomes}

Many gnomes few have taken to thievery in human towns where they can dress as children and confuse people with their illusions, though they will often leave town once it is generally known that there is a gnomish illusionist about -- their tricks are much easier to spot once everyone is on the lookout for them.

\begin{boxtext}

  ``You got me'', the little illusionist says as he steps out of the bushes.
  ``Okay'', he concedes, ``I'll show you the jewels I stole if you don't hurt me''.
  The chitincrawler sitting beside him slowly reveals itself to be a normal, boring bush.

\end{boxtext}

\newBeast[\Gn]{Gnome}% Name
  {gnomish_citizen}% label
  {small creatures, with a nasty habit of writing books inside footnotes, and leaving the remainder of the book as some kind of patchwork reference document}% description

A majority of gnomes are farmers, often with a light interest in alchemy and academic literature in general.  Some adventurous (or simply poor) gnomes end up as thieves in large-scale cities.

\gnome[\npc{\E\Gn}{Gnome}]

\newBeast[\Gn]{Gnomish Illusionist}% Name
  {gnomish_illusionist}% label
  {a type of bush, of no concern to anyone, unlike the thing staring at you from outside the window}% description

Most communities of gnomes hold at least one specialised illusionist.  When not studying they farm, bore people with philosophical questions and smoke extraordinarily long pipes.  On occasion, some will specialise in the invocation sphere in order to hunt animals.

\gnomishillusionist[\npc{\E\Gn}{Gnomish Illusionist}]

\paragraph{Tactics:} Illusion goes \emph{way} beyond casting illusions.
If people expect an illusionist to be present, illusionists will make a human warrior look like a badly-made illusion in the hopes of starting confusion, or perhaps even a fight.
If they're in basilisk territory, they will make the illusion of basilisk droppings before making an illusion of a basilisk's roar.
If an actual basilisk appears, an illusionist may lure it towards others with simple pig-like images, just good enough to fool a dumb animal.

\subsection[Humans]{\Hu\ Humans}
\index{Humans}

Being the most prolific race in the area, humans will most likely form the centrepiece of any campaign.
Elves do not have cities with taverns, open to anyone for trade.
Gnomes actively hide their towns until they are sure that they will not be attacked, and live so much underground that adventurers may well camp overnight by a gnomish warren without either troupe being aware of the other.
Humans are not always hospitable, but their great towns are geared towards trade to the point where anyone with enough tradeable goods is pushed in as if by some invisible hand into the local marketplace and then an inn.

\paragraph{Encounters:} Human roads can be distinguished by two key features -- their poor quality, and the fact that they are everywhere.
On these roads, two primary types of humans wander: traders and bandits.
Traders are far more common, and easy to spot due to their goods.
They always want more company, as it keeps them safe, and sometimes pay the \gls{guard} a small sum in order to stay with them while travelling.

Bandits, on the other hand, will only present themselves if they think they can win a fight.

\newBeast[\Hu]{Human Trader}% Name
  {human_trader}% label
  {some say the bravest of humans, they wander outside civilization with only their wits and a longbow}% description

At least half the humans in any given area are farmers.
Most organised militia are comprised of ex farmers who expect to return to farms, either to their own after sufficient payment or to new farms in conquered territory.
Humans may not have the greatest empathy with animals, but farmers certainly spend more time around inhuman animals than any other sentient race.

\humantrader[\npc{\E\Hu}{Trader}]

\newBeast[\Hu]{\Glsfmttext{guard}}% Name
  {human_soldier}% label
  {the extremities of humanity, sent to die heroically}% description

The \gls{guard} -- civilization's last hope (at least according to the builders) -- exist in every corner of \gls{fenestra}.
Many consider them a menace, as the requirements to join don't include table-manners, common courtesy, or cleanliness.

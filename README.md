# Setting

*Judgement* focusses on the kinds of events you would see in a world of 'wandering monsters'.
How do people trade?
How do they farm?
How do they even survive when anyone might encounter a basilisk on the roll of a '12'?

We begin with the temples which protect people from the gods.
Each one holds a divine monopoly on their protection.
The temple of frost is the guild of weavers, who shields people from death by cold.
The temple of hatred and bigotry make the armourers guild, who craft armour and negotiate peace deals before war arises.

The map isn't cheap.
You will need to set aside an hour (at least), to go through the steps to reveal a map of your little area in Fenestra.

The forests of Fenestra swarm with predators.
...well five.
They have five main predators, and the book takes a long look at how they interact with people and each other, at how they change their environment.

We finish with a few 'GM tips' just for running campaigns in Fenestra, with a troupe of the doomed Night Guard who resist the onslaught of beasts, and fight for civilization.

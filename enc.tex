\chapter{The Oracles}
\label{encounters}

Wherever you go in \gls{fenestra}, some situation or catastrophe emerges.
It starts at \pgls{broch}, where the \glspl{pc} receive a mission.
Then on the road, a random encounter interrupts the mission.

Wherever the troupe travels, roll on the chart, and find out what problems they find.

\subsection{Astronomy}

The \gls{ainumar} shines bright in the night sky, and appears a little larger than our moon does to us.
A raging storm moves across its face, which people can see about half of the year.
They believe that the gods live there, inside the moving eye of the storm.

\Gls{fenestra} swings around the \gls{ainumar}, coming so close in that it could almost kiss the gods, and then hurtles back to sit in empty space, far away from the Sun.
\index{Seasons}

\subsection{The \Glsfmtplural{cycle}}

Every sixty days \gls{fenestra} completes \pgls{cycle} around the \gls{ainumar}, before \pgls{storm} descends, bringing earthquakes, lightning, and tidal waves.
The \glspl{storm} last around a day, and mark a change in weather.
\index{Weather}

Each year has six \glspl{cycle}.

\Gls{cOne} \glsentrydesc{cOne}.

\Gls{cTwo} \glsentrydesc{cTwo}.

\Gls{cThree} \glsentrydesc{cThree}.

\Gls{cFour} \glsentrydesc{cFour}.

\Gls{cFive} \glsentrydesc{cFive}.

\Gls{cSix} \glsentrydesc{cSix}.

\subsection{Parallel Time}
\index{Parallel Time}

\Gls{fenestra}'s time keeps moving, just as ours does, but faster.
For every week which passes in our world, three weeks pass over there, so after a single month here, \gls{fenestra} experiences a full season.

While we have \trackMonth, \gls{fenestra} has `\showCycle' -- a \showTemperature\ season.
Just as we have twelve months, \emph{they} have twelve seasons.

After three years, all twelve seasons have passed and a new cycle begins.
\Gls{fenestra}'s inhabitants track `\glspl{cycle}' more often than years, unsurprisingly.

\end{multicols}


\section{Things on the Road}
\label{randomEncounters}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
Encounters on the road form the heart-beat of \gls{fenestra}, because they should be fast, and forgettable.
Some encounters will throw a spear in the spokes of any plan; others simply remind players that they're travelling.
In both cases, aim to resolve random encounters quickly.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item
  Roll $1D6$ to see how many \glspl{interval} until the next creature encounter.
  \item
  Roll $2D6$ to find the weather, \vpageref{encWeather}.
  \item
  Roll $2D6$ for the creature encounter, \vpageref{encFullMonsters} (-1 at night or evening).
  \begin{description}
    \item[On the roads] lower encounter rolls are replaced by traders.
    \item[Past the \glsentrytext{edge}] any noise has a 1 in 6 chance of summoning a creature.
  \end{description}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Weather}
\label{weather}
Cosmological and meteorological events can boost people's abilities to cast spells -- even those who had none before.
These bonuses stack with \glspl{boon}, so someone with the right know-how can (and do) stand under the unnatural darkness of an eclipse, holding the ground-up remains of a stirge queen, with auroch hooves boiled to melting point, at the top of a mountain,%
\footnote{High level spells often have such a long casting range that casters must climb high to see their target.}
screeching about opening a portal from a distant \gls{village} to an underground realm.

\weatherChart

While the average person makes little use of this time -- they have more pressing concerns given the sudden lack of Sunlight -- \glspl{witch} often plan grand rituals to coincide with \pgls{eclipse}, as the extra powers allow them to perform wide-ranging, potent \glspl{invocation}.

In the deep forests, this makes little difference, but an open road which once granted five miles of easy travel per \gls{interval} would only allow three miles once covered in frost.

With enough foot-fall, the penalty reduces to nothing, as others stamp the snow down, reducing it to frosty mud.

\Gls{fenestra} has an endless stream of creatures in her endless forest, eagerly searching for people.
Roll $1D6$ to find out how many \glspl{interval} until the next encounter.
Once the encounter ends, roll again.

\Glspl{basilisk} hibernate in the cold seasons, while warmer seasons have nights so warm that \glspl{basilisk} remain active.
Check the current season in \gls{fenestra} \vpageref{seasons}, then roll $2D6$ on the column matching the current season's temperature.
During warm seasons, a roll of \dicef{3} \dicef{4} means \pgls{woodspy}, but during \gls{cTwo}, it means a warthog, as they become more aggressive when food becomes scarce.

\makeAutoRule{morale}{Morale Checks}{When a creature's \glsfmtlongpl{hp} fall below $2D6$, it flees}
\index{Morale}
give the \gls{gm} an impartial way to rule when antagonists flee from combat.
At the start of an encounter, roll $2D6$ and leave the result on the table.
If the creature has more \glspl{hp} than the roll, it attacks; otherwise, watches the troupe.

\sidebox{
  \begin{boxtable}
    \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{\glsfmtlongpl{hp}} \\
    \hline
    \twoDice{5} & 10 (\textit{ATTACK!}) \\

    \twoDice{8} &  4 (\textit{RUN!}) \\
    \twoDice{8} &  2 (\textit{RUN!}) \\
  \end{boxtable}
}

\Glspl{crawler} often have 10~\glspl{hp}, so they often attack people the moment they spot them.
Griffins have fewer \glspl{hp} than \glspl{crawler}, so they are more likely to stalk the party, or simply leave.
And goblins might have only 5 or 6~\glspl{hp} -- they know how small they are, and prefer to spend time laying traps, or stealing equipment, rather than engaging directly.
Every \gls{hp} a creature loses could prompt it to turn and flee, so sometimes only wounded creatures will flee, while others keep fighting.

On a tie, the creature pauses to reassess the situation.
A single \gls{crawler} eyeing up a party might display its claws, then observe their reactions; if the troupe do nothing to change the situation (such as casting a spell, or making a loud noise) then the creature rolls again.

\Glspl{pc} do not take Morale checks -- the players decide when it's time to run away by the look of the situation.
Usually a good time is when all the \glspl{fp} have run out.
\index{Henchmen}%
However, \gls{npc} travelling with the \glspl{pc} still take morale checks as usual.%
\footnote{The \glsentrytext{gm} may also wish to cut all Morale checks for any \glspl{npc} with remaining \glsentrytext{fp}.}%

\makeAutoRule{noise}{Beyond the \Glsfmttext{edge}}{Each noise or light prompts a 1 in 6 chance of an encounter roll}
every noise or light becomes a beacon for creatures all around.
If anyone shouts, makes a fire, or otherwise draws attention to themselves, roll $1D6$; on the roll of a `1', roll on the encounter table immediately.

Deer and auroch flee when they hear a sound, but predators will immediately hunt for the source of the sound.

\subsection{The Civilization Rating}
\label{civilizationRating}
\index{Civilization Rating}

\Glspl{monster} don't generally attack towns.
It's not that they understand the risks, they just hear the sounds of \glspl{broch} and \glspl{village} which surround every town, and find food or death before going further in.

When travelling closer to a town, you keep rolling $2D6$ for encounters, but replace the lower results with traders.

\paragraph{Inner hamlets}
enjoy a much more quiet life than anywhere else in \gls{fenestra}.

\null
\begin{description}
  \item[Rolling over 9]
  means the usual encounter occurs, for whatever kind of land existed before the humans.
  Usually, this means forests.

  People who live in little unwalled farmhouses never see bears or auroch herds.
  Only rare \glspl{basilisk} and \glspl{crawler} have the speed and stupidity to strike this far into a human settlement.
  \item[Rolling 9]
  means an encounter with 9 bandits.

  Bandits only enter the inner circles when they have enough numbers to pose a serious threat to any \glspl{sunGuard} or angry farmers in the vicinity.
  \item[Rolling below 9]
  means that many wagons.

  So on the roll of `7', the troupe have encountered seven wagons coming towards them on the road.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Along the \gls{lonelyRoad}}
traders still travel between settlements routinely, but cannot travel with too many together -- the \glspl{bothy} will only fit so many bodies in at a time.

\null
\begin{description}
  \item[Rolling over 6] means the standard encounters emerge.
  \item[Hitting 6] means 6 bandits are waiting to attack, though they may not decide to attack the \glspl{pc} if the troupe looks well-armed.
  \item[Rolling under 6]
  means that number of trader wagons come towards the \glspl{pc}
  on the road.
\end{description}

\paragraph{Towards dead-end \glspl{village}}
a trader's wagon come along the road once a week, and never in great numbers.
One or two outer \glspl{village} just don't have much goods to trade.
Luckily, also puts a hard cap on the potential for bandits.

These dangling, dead-end roads work much like the forest, except for the fast and easy travel on the roads.

\begin{description}
  \item[Rolling 3]
  means three bandits are watching the road, and may have been watching for some days.
  \item[Rolling 2]
  means two wagons saunter lazily down the road, likely going to \glspl{village} where they have many friends.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Slide the Scales}
of the civilization up or down, depending on what looks right.
The rating can be anywhere from `0' (meaning `past the \gls{edge}') to `13' (which usually means `in the safety of a town').

\subsubsection{Travelling Traders}
\label{traders}
carry all sorts of items the \glspl{pc} might want, and they will say this loudly, shouting out what they have as soon as they see anyone ahead.

\encTraders

Each of your encounter dice also represent an interesting item the traders have.
For example, rolling \dicef{8}\dicef{3} would indicate that the \glspl{pc} can buy some rope and pitch.

\index{Selling Beasts}
Traders also purchase live \glspl{monster} for a number of \glspl{sp} equal to their \gls{cr}, or half that number if the body is well prepared.

\subsection{Fast Rolls}

Nobody likes holding up a session while the \gls{gm} makes multiple dice rolls.
You can combine all the regular encounters on the road into a single roll of $3D6$ to get an instant result.

\begin{description}
  \item
  Roll 3 dice read the next encounter.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Die 1]
    shows how many \glspl{interval} until the encounter.
    \item[Die 2 + die 3]
    tell you the weather.
    \item[Die 1 + die 2]
    tell you what creature emerges.
    \item[Die 3]
    may tell you the number of creatures appearing.
  \end{description}
  \item[During the day]
  staying close to settlements means a low encounter roll replaces the normal predators with traders.

  However, it can also mean a greater chance of bandits.

  \item[At night]
  roll as normal, with -1 to the encounter roll and weather rolls.
  The troupe will never find traders -- they do not travel at night.
  \item[In the deep forest]
  Every noise prompts a chance for an encounter.
\end{description}

\begin{exampletext}
  For example, the \gls{gm} rolls `\dicef{3} \dicef{4} \dicef{1}', during a `mild' season.

  On the first reading, this says `(\dicef{3}) after 3~\glspl{interval}, (\underline{\dicef{4} + \dicef{1}}) mist covers the area'.

  On the second reading, (\underline{\dicef{3} + \dicef{4}}) wolves arrive, (\dicef{1}) numbering 7.

\section{Missions at the \Glsfmttext{broch}}
\label{NGmissions}
\index{Adventure Generator}
\index{Missions}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
When players start a game, their characters will be \glspl{fodder}, with menial, pointless chores.
These menial chores do three things: first, they let players know their characters' place in society; second, they let new players get used to resolving actions; and third, they set the right tone for the pace.
In just one roll the characters complete a `mission', and the next mission may only take fifteen minutes' of real-world time.

Once \pgls{pc} or two have risen in rank, the missions will take more time, skill, and effort.
These higher-level missions have two purposes: first, they push the \glspl{pc} into the wider-world where \glspl{sq} force them into further action; and second, so you have something for them to do when you don't know what to do.

So when the game feels full, ignore the missions; the \gls{jotter} doesn't need anything right now.
But the moment the game feels like it has no direction, come back and roll up a new mission.

\paragraph{The troupe leader}
takes responsibility for the troupe's failure, whether or not anyone actually listens to them.
At the start of each mission, \pgls{jotter} will appoint the character with the highest rank (ties are broken by \roll{Charisma}{Deceit}).

\paragraph{Successful missions}
mean the \gls{jotter} will promote the lowest-ranking member of the troupe, or possibly two, if they did well.%
\footnote{Many of the \glsentrytext{guard} actively avoid gaining any kind of rank, as it only leads to more difficult duties.}
\index{Promotion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Roll $1D3$ for \glspl{fodder}.
  \item
  Roll $1D6$ for \glspl{gDigger}.
  \item
  Roll $1D6+1$ for \glspl{soldier}.
  \item
  Roll $1D6+2$ for \glspl{cutter}.
  \item
  Roll $1D6+3$ for \glspl{ranger}.
\end{itemize}

Then add a complication with the same bonus as before (\autopageref{missionComplications}).

\subsubsection{Goal}
\index{Missions}

\ngMissions

\subsubsection{Complications}

Add a bonus for rank, as before.

\missionComplications

\subsection{At the \Glsfmttext{broch}}

\Glspl{broch} often run short on supplies, especially when they don't have many \glspl{village} nearby.
Once the \glspl{pc} arrive at \pgls{broch}, make a roll to see what it lacks.

\brochDerths

If an area suffers from poverty and death, it always affects supplies to the \glspl{broch}.
In this case, you might roll two dice at each \gls{broch} to see what's missing, and increase this roll until prosperity returns.

\end{multicols}


\section{Emergent Situations}
\label{roadEncounters}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
The \glspl{pc} will find more trouble than monsters as they travel.

If enough people gather rocks, it becomes a cenotaph, and takes the name of the fallen.
If more rocks follow, the cenotaph becomes \pgls{bothy}.

Anyone using \pgls{bothy} must gather and leave as much firewood as they found when they entered, except the \gls{guard}, who must leave even more, fix anything which needs fixing.
Nobody will trust someone known to leave \pgls{bothy} in a bad state, but if \glspl{guard} leave them in a bad way, they will face questions in the \gls{court}.

\subsection{Lonely Taverns}
\label{lonelyTaverns}
\index{Lonely Taverns}

These taverns exist on long stretches of road, far from any town, and
charge high prices for a drink. They must live off traders passing
through, and survive whatever the forest brings out.

Normal people don't stay for long.
Those who stay a while often have problems with the local
law, as these places often make their own laws.
Barkeeps punish any robbery close to the tavern harshly, but don't often care about what people do around the towns.
This makes these taverns a safe intermediate location where anyone can talk in peace.

Of course, bandits won't announce themselves as such when speaking with \glspl{guard}, but then the \glspl{guard} often won't announce their employment either, no matter how obvious that sword on their back makes them.

\subsubsection{The Barkeep}

Roll $1D6$ to find this season's barkeep (they change all the time):

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  A veteran of the \gls{guard}, with a hundred war-stories. Of course
  when he tells them, nobody can get a drink, so don't ask!
  \item
  Someone from point 4 on the map, hiding here with a bounty on their head for thieving from \pgls{warden}.
  \item
  An outlander from a land so far away, nobody has ever heard of it.
  Every story she tells sounds made-up, but the strange accent shows she really does come from somewhere distant.
  \item
  A powerful \gls{witch} who swore an oath never to use magic again.
  He won't say why.
  \item
  A collective -- you stay as long as you like, earn your keep, then go
  when you please. Sometimes in the colder Seasons, the place just lies
  barren.
  \item
  A dwarf who records all he can.
  The patrons say he works as a spy for someone, but they disagree about whom.
\end{dlist}

\subsubsection{The Menu}
\index{Menus|see {Lonely Tavern}}

start with $2D6$ \gls{guard} \gls{gDigger}.
Roll $3D6$ for the rest, and accept every unique result.

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  An elf who doesn't speak the \gls{tradeTongue}.
  \item
  \Pgls{mixer} from the \gls{templeOfSickness}, on a mission to recruit from the \glspl{village}.
  \item
  \Pgls{doula}, carrying a map of one point (roll $1D6+4$), and preparing to make another
  \item
  A piper who really wants to practice, and keeps justifying why they should be allowed to make loud noises.
  \item

  \item
  \Pgls{seeker}, here to collect information.

\subsection{Trouble at the \Glsfmttext{court}}
\label{courtVerdicts}

\Gls{fenestra}'s legal system can be unpredictable, but must never be dull.
When looking for a legal verdict, in the \gls{court} the accuser and accused make speeches, and make a resisted roll of \roll{Charisma}{Empathy}.%
\footnote{See \autopageref{pitOfJustice} for the building's structure.}

%\null
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  The accuser always gets +1.
  \item
  Either side gets +1 for good evidence.
  \item
  Either side gets +1 for entertaining evidence.
  \item
  Membership in the \pgls{templeOfJustice} grants +3 to the roll.
  \item
  Knowing the \gls{warden} grants +1 to the roll.
  \item
  Either side gets -3 for insulting the \gls{warden}.
  \item
  If the jester likes one side, they gain +1.
  \item
  If the jester hates one side, they gain -1.
\end{itemize}

The jester is fickle, the crowds love a twist, and the \gls{warden}'s patience grows thin.

\begin{description}
  \item[A successful Accusation]
  means a roll for punishment.
  \item[A tie]
  means both characters may be in trouble: roll on the mistrial results, \vpageref{mistrials}.
  \item[A failed accusation]
  means there is no punishment for the accused.
  However, if the accuser is not a high-standing member of a guild, they will receive punishment for wasting everyone's time.
  Roll for the accuser's punishment!
\end{description}

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  \ifodd\value{temperature}
    The accused must pay a fine of $1D6\times 1D6\times 1D6\times 10$~\glspl{sp}.
    Every day unpaid raises the fine by 10\%.
    If they owe more than 2,500~\glspl{sp}, they must go to prison until they repay all debts.

    (interest reduces to 5\% per day while in prison)
  \else
    The accused becomes the jester (the jester was getting old anyway).
  \fi
  \item
    The accused becomes the executioner -- the job is `for life!' (and apparently the crowd find this hilarious).
  \item
    The Jester demands the accused become a `\gls{basilisk} bather', and wash the stench off \pgls{basilisk} as penance for their filthy deeds.
    To everyone's shock, the \gls{warden} agrees!
  \item
  The accused seems like capable person\ldots Capable of violence!
  Time to join the \gls{guard} as fodder.%
  \footnote{See \autopageref{fodder}. Anyone already in the \gls{guard} becomes demoted, but has no other punishment.}
  \item
  Death by irony!
  The accused will be killed by the very thing they inflicted on others.
  \item
  Death by hanging!
  The accused must die!

  (Four \glspl{sunGuard} enter, carrying swords and rope)
\end{dlist}

\index{Mistrial}
\paragraph{Mistrials}
mean that both accuser and accused must pay the price.
After all, just because the accuser has wasted everyone's time, doesn't mean the defendant doesn't look like the `wrong type', and if the accused makes their own accusations (as most do) then justice may demand that both suffer.

\label{mistrials}
\begin{dlist}
  \item
  Boring!
  We're here for justice, not a lecture.
  Both accuser and accused go to prison for $1D6$ days, then the trial repeats.
  \item
  Time to make up and be friends, during\ldots

  Trial!

  ~by!

  BEAST!

  Let in the \ifodd\value{r4} \glspl{crawler}\else griffins\fi!

  (everyone gets a shortsword, the \gls{warden} declares any survivors innocent)
  \item
  Another accuser appears, to accuse the accuser of an even worse crime (this nullifies the first crime, as everyone forgets about it).
  Restart the trial!
  \item
  Accusation-switch!
  Accuser becomes accused as a new witness comes to light.
  (Restart the show and roll for the other side).
  \item
  $1D6$~\glspl{sp} fine each, for wasting time.
  \item
  The \gls{warden} feels lenient -- everyone goes free.

\chapter{Encounters at the Crossroads}
\index{Seasons}
\label{encounters}

\Gls{fenestra}'s institutions, structure, politics, religion, and \emph{food} all revolve around the constant problems presented by monstrous creatures wandering around the world.
These encounters do not occur every hour of every day; just as deer walk through dark forests for a lifetime, so people can also visit a nearby \gls{village} without certain death.
However, they will experience a \textit{reasonable danger} of death if they walk carefully, and worse if they wander carelessly.

\section{Things on the Road}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{Daily Encounters}

\begin{speechtext}
  Everyone travels together, in heavy wagons, and bows ready for action.
  But once you arrive back home, the traders finish and want to move on by morning, which doesn't leave much time to say `hello' to everyone.
  So you decide to leave with the next trading caravan, but a days later and nobody's arrived.
  Nobody tells you to go, but when food's running low you just kinda \emph{feel} it.

  The little places by the towns don't see much danger, so if you're not too far from a big place, you might just walk to the nearest road and see if you can join a caravan heading back to town.
  Of course the bow's at the ready, and a spear if you can stand the extra weight.

  When you spot a creature, you can try to stare it down.
  If that doesn't work, give it a nasty sting and most go away.
  Gotta be careful close to the cold though -- once the beasts feel the frost coming on they get \emph{fearless}.

  Once the cold settles in, the forest calms down.
  Most of the big nasty ones sleep under the snow until it melts.

Encounters adjust, depending on the season, time of day, and how far the troupe have travelled from civilization.

\begin{description}
  \item
  Roll 3 dice read the next encounter.
  \begin{description}
    \item[Die 1]
    shows how many \glspl{interval} until the encounter.
    \item[Die 2 + die 3]
    tell you the weather.
    \item[Die 1 + die 2]
    tell you what creature emerges.
    \item[Die 3]
    may tell you the number of creatures appearing.
  \end{description}
  \item[During the day]
  staying close to settlements means a low encounter roll replaces the normal predators with traders.

  However, it can also mean a greater chance of bandits.

  \item[At night]
  roll as normal, with -1 to the encounter roll and weather rolls.
  The troupe will never find traders -- they do not travel at night.
  \item[In the deep forest]
  Every noise prompts a chance for an encounter.
\end{description}

\begin{exampletext}
  For example, the \gls{gm} rolls `\dicef{3} \dicef{4} \dicef{1}', during a `mild' season.

  On the first reading, this says `(\dicef{3}) after 3~\glspl{interval}, (\underline{\dicef{4} + \dicef{1}}) mist covers the area'.

  On the second reading, (\underline{\dicef{3} + \dicef{4}}) wolves arrive, (\dicef{1}) numbering 7.

\diceTrio{3}{4}{1}{}{Mist}{\dicef{1} +6 Wolves}

\subsubsection{The Civilization Rating}
\label{civilizationRating}
\index{Civilization Rating}
represents how the roads become safer near \pgls{broch}, and safer still closer to a town.
At the outer \glspl{village}, the only safety comes from \pgls{broch} which blasts noise to summon beasts, so archers can sting them.
\Glspl{broch} can summon a few beasts every week like this, and either kill them, or give them enough of a nasty shock that they leave the area.
Of course, their children won't remember the lesson, so the solution will not work for long.

By the time one sees a town's walls, everything is safe during the day.
Along the road between settlements, a few beasts wander through at night, making these areas always a little dangerous.

Almost nothing gets through the protective layers of \glspl{broch} and outer \glspl{village} which surround towns.
Wild predators could move between the \glspl{village} if they wanted, but they don't have the brains -- most just move towards the first noises they hear, and then receive a nasty sting from archers.
After enough predators die or leave an area, it becomes more reliably safe, at least during the daylight.

You can think of the Civilization Rating as a line which moves down, slowly altering the encounter tables.
Past the end of the last road, the forest replaces the all traders with beasts.

\subsection{Traders \& Nomads}

While moving, everyone meets other travellers head-on, moving in the opposite direction from them.
They briefly swap news of the road behind, occasionally make a trade, then move on.

\encTraders

Each of your encounter dice also represent an interesting item the traders have.
For example, rolling \dicef{8}\dicef{3} would indicate that the \glspl{pc} can buy some rope and pitch.

\subsubsection{Noises in the Forest}

In the dark forests, where towering trees dampen the Sunlight, any out-of-place noise, light, or smell, can excite and draw in the predators which live there.
Whenever the troupe draw attention to themselves, roll $1D6$.
On the roll of a `1', roll for a random encounter.

You can pull this off quickly with $3D6$, where only the first die indicates the encounter, where the others indicate \emph{which} (if any).

\subsection{Weather}
\label{weather}
Cosmological and meteorological events can boost people's abilities to cast spells -- even those who had none before.
These bonuses stack with \glspl{boon}, so someone with the right know-how can (and do) stand under the unnatural darkness of an eclipse, holding the ground-up remains of a stirge queen, with auroch hooves boiled to melting point, at the top of a mountain,%
\footnote{High level spells often have such a long casting range that casters must climb high to see their target.}
screeching about opening a portal from a distant \gls{village} to an underground realm.

\subsubsection{Cold Snaps}
\index{Cold Snap \glsentrytext{R}}
\index[mana]{Fate!Cold Snaps \glsentrytext{R}}
drain the life from characters and wildlife in a blink.
Until the weather warms up again, all actions outdoors inflict an additional \gls{ep} or more, depending on clothing.
Someone journeying outdoors effectively naked will receive 3 \glspl{ep}, per \gls{interval}.

The mass disturbances in the air, mixed with the darkness, creates a kind of magic in the air, which grants +1 to everyone's Fate Sphere, including those who cannot normally cast spells.

\subsubsection{Earthquakes}
\index{Earthquakes \glsentrytext{R}}
\index{Quakes}
\index[mana]{Earth!Quakes \glsentrytext{R}}
can topple \gls{village} walls, houses collapse inward, and gnomish warrens have their planning tested from the foundations to the rooves.
Despite the shaking, most structures remain standing.
Architects in \gls{fenestra} design castles for quakes, and dwarvish settlements, down at the edge of the \gls{deep}, often feel nothing, as underground caverns don't shake during quakes as badly as the surface does.

When quakes alter rock, everyone with the tiniest understanding of magic finds themselves able to speak to stone, at least a little, as rocks and ice start to wake up.
This time grants a +1 bonus to everyone's Earth Skill, for the short duration of the quake.

\subsubsection{Eclipses}
\index{Eclipses \glsentrytext{R}}
\index[mana]{Air!Eclipses \glsentrytext{R}}
plunge \gls{fenestra} into sudden daytime darkness, as the \gls{ainumar} blocks the Sun.
For this entire \gls{interval}, the winds becomes more pliable, and anyone with a voice to speak gains +1 to their Air Skill.

The average person makes little use of this time -- they have more pressing concerns given the sudden lack of Sunlight.
But casters often plan grand rituals to coincide with an eclipse, as the extra powers allow them to perform wide-ranging, potent spells.

\subsubsection{Floods}
\index{Floods \glsentrytext{R}}
\index[mana]{Water!Floods \glsentrytext{R}}
damage infrastructure worse than earthquakes.
They rot food, and degrade the foundations of houses in subtle ways, which only become apparent years later.
High fortifications remain untouched, but underground dwelling runs the risk of water pouring in from above, and driving everything inside up into the Sunlight.

The predators of \gls{fenestra} seem to have an instinct for floods, and will camp outside any homely holes in their territories.

Travel during a flood poses serious problems -- any affected area will half the travellers' rate of movement.

While floods occur, everyone gains a +1 Bonus to their Water Skill.

\subsubsection{Heatwaves}
\index{Heatwaves}
\index[mana]{Fire!Heatwaves \glsentrytext{R}}
pose problems for anyone who wants to wear armour.
All travel in direct Sunlight will have the travellers endure an additional +1 \glspl{ep} when wearing loose-fitting clothing, or +2 when wearing inappropriate clothes.
Armour of any kind does not count as `appropriate', so a heatwave can force any warrior to remove their armour.

During a heatwave, everyone gains a +1 bonus to their Fire Skill.

\subsubsection{Snow}
\index{Snow}
\index{Marching!Snow}
slows travel.
Travelling over snow-covered lands reduces the standard travel to half.
In the deep forests, this makes little difference, but an open road which once granted five miles of easy travel per \gls{interval} would only allow three miles once covered in frost.

With enough foot-fall, the penalty reduces to nothing, as others stamp the snow down, reducing it to frosty mud.

\section{Morale}
\label{morale}
\index{Morale}
\begin{multicols}{2}

\noindent
When combat seems likely, roll $2D6$ and leave the result on the table.
If the creature has more \glspl{hp} than the roll, it attacks; otherwise, it flees.

\sidebox{
  \begin{boxtable}
    \textbf{Roll} & \textbf{\glsfmtlongpl{hp}} \\
    \hline
    \twoDice{5} & 10 (\textit{ATTACK!}) \\
    \twoDice{5} &  8 (\textit{ATTACK!}) \\
    \twoDice{5} &  5 (\textit{wait\ldots}) \\
    \twoDice{8} &  4 (\textit{RUN!}) \\
    \twoDice{8} &  2 (\textit{RUN!}) \\
  \end{boxtable}
}

Chitincrawlers often have 10~\glspl{hp}, so they often attack people the moment they spot them.
Griffins have fewer \glspl{hp} than chitincrawlers, so they attack less often.
And goblins might have only 5 or 6~\glspl{hp} -- they know how small they are, and prefer to spend time laying traps, or stealing equipment, rather than engaging directly.
Every \gls{hp} a creature loses could prompt it to turn and flee, so sometimes only wounded creatures will flee, while others keep fighting.

On a tie, the creature pauses to reassess the situation.
A single chitincrawler eyeing up a party might display its claws, then observe their reactions; if the troupe do nothing to change the situation (such as casting a spell, or making a loud noise) then the creature rolls again.

\subsubsection{Decisions before Dice}

The dice only exist to provide a neutral result, not a sensible result.
Creatures always fight when backed into a corner, or starving.
Creatures never fight when they will probably die.%
\footnote{Exceptions include particularly dim creatures, who don't know what's good for them.
See chitincrawlers, \vpageref{chitin:tactics}.}

Use your best judgement about whether or not something, or someone, attacks the troupe, before rolling.
A trio of griffins will not attack a loud group of one hundred humanoids, all moving together, but will definitely swoop for a small child who has wandered away from the group.

\Glspl{npc} work exactly the same as \gls{fenestra}'s predators, but display their reactions differently.
\Glspl{npc} who fail a Morale check may act friendly and harmless, if they think the \glspl{pc} will not attack them.

\Glspl{pc} do not take Morale checks -- the players decide when it's time to run away by the look of the situation.
Usually a good time is when all the \glspl{fp} have run out.
\index{Henchmen}%
However, \gls{npc} travelling with the \glspl{pc} still take morale checks as usual.%
\footnote{The \glsentrytext{gm} may also wish to cut all Morale checks for any \glspl{npc} with remaining \glsentrytext{fp}.}%

\end{multicols}

\section{Emergent Situations}

The \glspl{pc} will find more trouble than monsters as they travel.
Whenever a journey ends, a situation begins.

\begin{multicols}{2}

\subsection{On the Road}

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{bothy}}
\glsdesc{bothy}.

Each \gls{bothy} begins when someone dies on the road, and others leave rocks there to pay their respect.
If enough people gather rocks, it becomes a cenotaph, and takes the name of the fallen.
If more rocks follow, the cenotaph becomes \pgls{bothy}.

Anyone using \pgls{bothy} must gather and leave as much firewood as they found when they entered, except the \gls{guard}, who must leave even more, fix anything which needs fixing.
Nobody will trust someone known to leave \pgls{bothy} in a bad state, but if \glspl{guard} leave them in a bad way, they will face questions in the \gls{court}.

Roll to check \pgls{bothy}'s circumstances upon arrival:

\bothyEvents

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtplural{broch}}
\glsdesc{broch}.

This slaughterhouse of predators keeps nearby \glspl{village} safe, although it also teaches predators not to approach large, noisy towers, and stick to the tasty people and horses on the roads.

Roll to check \pgls{broch}'s circumstances upon arrival:

\brochEvents

\needspace{18em}
\subsection{\Glsfmtplural{village}}

\subsubsection{\Glsfmttext{village} Features}
\label{villageFeatures}
should make the name, so everyone can remember the place easily.
As the troupe approach a new \gls{village}, roll $3D6$ to find its population, features, and the current events.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Die 1 $\times 50 =$ population.
  \item
  Die 1 + 2 = feature.
  \item
  Die 2 + 3 = feature.
  \item
  Die 1 + 3 = event (\vpageref{villageEvents}).
\end{itemize}

Note down the \gls{village}'s features, and combine them with the landscape to make a name.
\Pgls{village} with \nameref{screechMoss} nestled in hills could receive the name `Mossdale', or `Screechvale'.

\labelledDiceTrio{2}{3}{1}{moat}{copper spikes}{mouthdiggers}

\noindent
For example, once the troupe reach \pgls{village}, the \gls{gm} might roll $3D6$ and find \pgls{village} with copper spikes around the wall, and a moat.
The population is 100 people, and the inhabitants are dealing with a mouthdigger problem.

\encVillageFeatures

\subsubsection{\Glsfmttext{village} Events}
\label{villageEvents}
can be re-rolled each time the troupe approach.
Encounter rolls continue, as usual; \glspl{village} regularly have to deal with predator attacks.

\encVillageEvent

\subsection{Towns}
\index{Towns!Rulers}

Officially, the \gls{guard} should not enter towns.
No taverns, nor markets.
But they always find an excuse, or unguarded entrance, when they need something.

\paragraph{The Town \gls{warden}}
\label{encTownWarden}
can have a major impact on any location.

\begin{dlist}
  \item
  Multiple \underline{warring factions} -- roll twice more, with +1 to the second roll.
  \item
  A \underline{Warlord}, recently out of the \gls{guard}, amassing an army to expand their power.
  Shipments of weapons come from the road to other lands
  (see \vref{roadOut}).
  \item
  A \underline{greedy \gls{warden}}, who demands 10\% tithes from all who enter.
  Any neighbouring fiends annoy and fascinate them equally.
  \item
  A \gls{witch} with no experience or business ruling has managed to muscle their way into the \gls{templeOfJustice}.
  They once killed a fiend, and feel this has prepared them to manage \pgls{court} and arranged marriages.

  The \gls{witch} has killed the same type of fiend as the highest fiend on the map (if none, it was a dragon).
  \item
  A \underline{Spoilt noble} who has never seen a farmer in their life.
  \item
  A \underline{servant of the next fiend} on the map (counted by point number).
  All who oppose this \gls{warden} disappear on the road.
  \item
  A \underline{Crime-Lord}, with a history of theft, now risen to fortune\ldots but not nobility.
\end{dlist}

\end{multicols}

\Gls{guard} recruits can expect harsh duties.
The character with the highest rank will be asked to lead the party (ties are broken by \roll{Charisma}{Deceit}), and give a bonus to the first die-roll.

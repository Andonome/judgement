    \item
    A travelling tradesman wants you to
      \begin{dlist}
        \item
        come guard his caravan on a journey to the next town.
        He'll pay you 30~\glspl{sp}.
        \item
        take this shortsword -- it should keep you safe.
        \item
        \ifodd\value{r4b}
          tell him about what the \gls{guard} are up to.
          He will join you on the road and pay 5 \glspl{sp} per person for the `news'.
        \else
          join her going to the next town, and vouch that the bag of 300 \glspl{sp} belongs to the \gls{guard} and not her, so she doesn't have to pay a tax on it.
        \fi
        \item
        tell her about any interesting things you might have found on the road\ldots
        anything you maybe haven't reported to the \gls{jotter}\ldots
        maybe something you need help getting rid of\ldots?
        \item
        help deliver something to a local fiend.
        The tradesman has just what it wants
      (as per \autopageref{fiendDesires}).
        She can pay a total of 60~\glspl{sp}.
        \item
        break a friend out of jail in a nearby town.
        He had no idea those items were stolen!
      \end{dlist}
    Tell nobody -- you could get in a lot of trouble for moonlighting
    (re-roll to find your orders).
  \item
  Seek out the
    \begin{dlist}
      \item
      \gls{guard} deserter, and prosecute them in the local \gls{court}.
      \item
      local oddity and find out what you can
      (see \nameref{mapOddities}, \autopageref{mapOddities}).
      \item
      elven fence, who sells stolen items to traders from far-away lands.
      \item
      native speaker of Gnomish, because someone needs a book translated.
      \item
      doula, famed for her healing abilities, to help the local warden.
      \item
      local fiend, and find out what it wants
      (as per `\nameref{fiendDesires}', \autopageref{fiendDesires}).
    \end{dlist}
  \item
  Capture a
    \begin{dlist}
      \item
      bard, known for spreading completely unverified rumours about the wardens.
      \item
      witch, who keeps casting strange and deadly enchantments on local plants.
      \item
      place where mana wells up from the ground. It lies somewhere in the forest, or so the bards sing.
      \item
      creature for the arena; the wardens want to see some good sport.
      \item
      ray of full moonlight.
      The doula need it for something, but won't explain what they mean.
      \item
      thief in the act. He robs wardens at night, but nobody has seen his face.
    \end{dlist}
  \item
  Travel beyond the \gls{edge} and
    \begin{dlist}
    \item
    find where those goblins come from.
    \item
    confirm what you can about this map -- it makes some strange claims.
    \item
    bring back a feast of basilisk eggs -- the warden wants to impress a lady.
    \item
    recover the golden wand from the lost city.
    We hear it lies there, but if we heard wrong, return with evidence that there is no lost city there.
    \item
    confirm the doula's claims about the great site for starting a new village.
    \item
    deliver this message to the local elves, or gnomes, or whatever they are.
    \end{dlist}
  \item
  Take the day off -- you've earned it!
  \end{enumerate}

\newcommand\missionComplications{
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The Jotter has assigned a Cutter to stand watch over everything you do.
    They won't help, they only make sardonic comments.
    \item
    Take this Wanderer from the \gls{paperGuild} with you to chronicle the mission.%
    \footnote{See \autopageref{knowledgeWanderer} for Wanderers.}
    And \emph{don't} let him get hurt.
    \item
    There are two of them!
    \begin{exampletext}
      If the troupe need to transport a wounded ranger, they hear about another wounded ranger en route, and have to rescue the other as well (after finding them).
      If the troupe need to find a doula, then the doula tells them they first have to help find her sister.
    \end{exampletext}
    \item
    Roll twice more!
    \item
    The troupe leader has developed a nasty disease (see \autopageref{diseases}).
    \begin{dlist}
      \item
      Breathrot
      \item
      Corpse Hands
      \item
      Mindflash Syndrome
      \item
      Guardbane
      \item
      Spychoke
      \item
      Torpid Flesh
    \end{dlist}
    \item
    Rival \glspl{guard} work on a related mission.
    Roll the second $D6$ again, to find their quarry.
    Both items are related.

    \begin{exampletext}
      For example, if you roll a \ref{riderMissions} then \ref{fiendLetter}, the \glspl{pc} would have to deliver a letter to a fiend.
      If the rivals rolled a \ref{taxesMission}, they would have to threaten a village into paying its taxes, and these two missions would interfere with each other somehow.

      Perhaps both missions involve targets who travel together, or perhaps one mission's success leads to the other's failure.
    \end{exampletext}
    \item
    A distant warden hopes for their failure, and has sent his men to stop them.
    \item
    A nearby fiend does not want the mission to succeed.
    \item
    The Temple of Poison%
    \footnote{See \autopageref{god:Poison}.}
    has a vested interest in the mission failing, and will influence all the groups they can to stop the troupe succeeding.
    If the troupe have an encounter with an intelligent creature (such as a bandit or trader) there is a 50\% chance they work as a spy for the Temple of Poison.
